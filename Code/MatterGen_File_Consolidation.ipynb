Read each CIF file from source directories\n","# 2. Update the data_image header to ensure unique sequential numbering\n","# 3. Save to master directory with standardized filenames (struct_0001.cif, etc.)\n","# 4. Maintain original structural data while only updating identifiers\n","#\n","# FILE NAMING CONVENTION:\n","# - struct_XXXX.cif where XXXX is zero-padded to 4 digits\n","# - Zero-padding ensures proper sorting in file browsers and analysis tools\n","# - Example: struct_0001.cif, struct_0002.cif, ..., struct_0800.cif\n","#\n","# DOWNSTREAM ANALYSIS:\n","# The consolidated files can be analyzed using:\n","# - VESTA (visualization and structure analysis)\n","# - pymatgen (Python-based materials analysis)\n","# - Materials Project database (structure comparison)\n","# - ASE (Atomic Simulation Environment)\n","#\n","# LOCAL EXECUTION NOTE:\n","# This script was executed on a local Windows machine, NOT in Google Colab.\n","# File paths are specific to the local filesystem and would need to be\n","# updated for other users or environments.\n","# ============================================================================"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"8FsmFkZhCCKh"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
